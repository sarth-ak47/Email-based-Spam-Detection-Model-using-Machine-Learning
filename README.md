# Email-based-Spam-Detection-Model-using-Machine-Learning
This project is focused on building a machine learning model that classifies email messages as spam or ham (not spam) using natural language processing and logistic regression.


🔍 Project Highlights
✅ Built using Python, scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn

📁 Trained on a labeled dataset from Kaggle

📊 Performed EDA, text preprocessing, and TF-IDF vectorization

🤖 Developed a Logistic Regression model for binary classification

🧠 Evaluated model using accuracy score and confusion matrix

📈 Visualized top keywords in spam/ham messages using bar charts
